Each multiple-choice quiz problem is based on a "root question," from which the system generates different correct and incorrect choices each time you take the quiz. Thus, you can test yourself on the same material multiple times. We strongly urge you to continue testing on each topic until you complete the quiz with a perfect score at least once. Simply click the "Reset" button at the bottom of the page for a new variant of the quiz.<br />
After submitting your selections, the system will score your quiz, and for incorrect answers will provide an "explanation" (sometimes for correct ones too). These explanations should help you get the right answer the next time around. To prevent rapid-fire guessing, the system enforces a minimum of 10 minutes between each submission of solutions.

<p> [Q8] </p>

<p>
Suppose there is a UML superclass Movies with subclasses. Consider the following possible pairs of subclasses: <BR/>

1. {B,NB}: B = movies in which Kevin Bacon appears; NB = movies in which Kevin Bacon does not appear <BR/>
2. {B,R}: B = movies in which Kevin Bacon appears; R = movies in which Julia Roberts appears <BR/>
3. {B,K}: B = movies in which Kevin Bacon appears; K = movies in which Val Kilmer appears <BR/>
4. {L,S}: L = movies more than 100 minutes long; S = movies less than 105 minutes long <BR/>
</p>

<p>
	Consider whether each pair of subclasses is complete or incomplete (partial), and whether the pair is overlapping or disjoint (exclusive). (Depending on your knowledge, you may have to do some web searches on movies to get the right classification.) Which of the following statements is correct?
</p>

<ol>
	<li> {B, NB} is incomplete and overlapping.</li>
	<li> {B, NB} is complete and disjoint.</li>
	<li> {B, K} is incomplete and overlapping.</li>
	<li> {B, K} is complete and disjoint</li>
</ol>
