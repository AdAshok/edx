0.  GIF, PNG-8: 256 colors. 
    PNG-24, BMP, JPEG: 16.777.216 colors.
1.  GIF. APNG and MNG formats (both derived from PNG) supports animations.
2.  Lossless compression algorithms do not apply any direct change to the compressed data (data can be retrieved unchanged).
    Lossy compression algorithms instead achieve a better compression ratio, sacrificing part of the file data. 
3.  JPEG.
4.  The actual file's data are not erased from the clusters on which they resided. The OS simply moves those clusters to the
    list of available ones, signaling that they can be reused.
5.  Apart from physically destroying the hard drive, by using specific softwares which will overwrite all the hard drive
    sectors with some data patterns.
6.  stdint.h contains some integers types introduced by C99 standard.
7.  To make the code portable among different low level/hardware implementations for a given data type (i.e. an integer). 
8.  BYTE: 1 byte, DWORD: 4 bytes, LONG: 4 bytes, WORD: 2 bytes.
9.  0x424d.
10. bfSize specifies, in hexadecimal notation, the magic number which identifies the file format (BMP in this case).
    biSize specifies the size in bytes related to the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure (the size of the header). 
11. If biHeight is negative, that means that the BMP file is a top-down DIB and its origin is in the upper-left corner.
12. The biBitCount field specifies the color depth (bpp, bits per pixel) for the file (2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32).
13. We could run out of RAM, storage space on the disk or maybe we've specified an invalid name for the output file "outfile".
14. We want to read 1 RGBTRIPLE at time. On each call, fread will read 3 byte of data (an R-G-B value for a given pixel).
15. 1
16. fseek is used to move across a file.
17. SEEK_CUR represents the current position in the file.
18. Milo Banana dun it.
